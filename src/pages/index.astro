    <section>
      <p>
        I build AI-native products—systems where the AI isn't a feature bolted on,
        but the core of how the thing works.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently building autonomous AI agents that trade markets 24/7.
        Custom analysis, strategic execution, genuine intelligence.
        Not another "crypto bot."
      </p>
      <p>
        I use AI tools extensively to build these products. Claude Code for development,
        LLMs for analysis, AI everywhere it makes sense. The meta of using AI to build
        AI products is interesting—and sometimes weird.
