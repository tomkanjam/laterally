The AI discourse is stuck on the wrong question.

"Will AI take my job?" dominates every conversation. Pundits debate which professions survive. Workers panic. LinkedIn influencers post survival guides.

It's a distraction.

Yes, work will change. It always does. The printing press, the assembly line, the computer—every major tool reshapes labour. We adapt. We've always adapted. This isn't the threat.

The threat is who ends up controlling the most powerful tool ever built.

## AI doesn't want anything

Here's what most people miss: AI has no goals. No desires. No ambition. It doesn't want to take your job. It doesn't want to help you either. It doesn't *want*.

It just executes.

Whatever objective it's given, it pursues. At scale. Without hesitation. Without fatigue. Without questioning whether it should.

That's not a flaw. That's the design. And it's exactly why the "who controls it" question matters more than "what can it do."

## The actual threat model

Forget the sci-fi scenario where AI wakes up and decides humanity is a problem. That's not how this works.

The realistic threat is simpler: concentrated AI capability in the hands of actors—state or corporate—with objectives that don't align with yours. Operating at a scale no human workforce could match. Running 24/7. Optimising relentlessly for whatever metric they've chosen.

The machine does what it's told. The question is who's telling it.

## Tools and weapons

A hammer builds houses. It also cracks skulls. The hammer doesn't care which.

AI is the same, except it scales infinitely and operates autonomously. That's a different category of tool. The gap between "useful" and "dangerous" isn't in the technology. It's in the deployment.

We're spending all our attention on job retraining programs while the real game—who controls the infrastructure, who sets the objectives, who benefits from the scale—plays out elsewhere.

## The point

I'm not saying ignore the economic shifts. Adapt. Learn the tools. Stay useful.

But don't mistake the distraction for the threat.

The danger was never the machine. It's the hands on the controls.
