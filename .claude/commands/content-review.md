Review recent development progress in the vyx app repo and suggest content for the Laterally personal brand.

Check the vyx repo at `/home/developer/projects/vyx`:
1. Recent git commits (last 3-7 days): `git -C /home/developer/projects/vyx log --oneline -20`
2. Recently closed issues: `ls /home/developer/projects/vyx/context/issues/closed/`
3. Current work in progress: `ls /home/developer/projects/vyx/context/issues/open/`

For each interesting finding:
- Identify the content angle (build-in-public, ai-wisdom, or founder-pov)
- Draft a tweet or note in the Ultrathinker voice
- Ensure privacy guidelines are followed (no product name, no identifying details)
- Save drafts to content/drafts/

Present the drafts for approval. Do not post without explicit approval.
